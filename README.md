# Flask-API-REST-Ollivanders
The aim of this project is to learn how to make a web REST API connecting the logics of the project in [this repo](https://github.com/BertaVR/OlivandersProjectPython/). We connceted it to a MYsql database using the ORM SQLAlchemy from flask. We made most of the project together using liveshare.
